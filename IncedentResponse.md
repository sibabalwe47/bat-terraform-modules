## Incident Response Process

---

### Part 1: Acquire, Preserve, Document Evidence

1. You become aware of potential indicators of compromise (IoCs). These could come in various forms:
   - An internal ticketing system (the sources of the ticket are varied and could include any of the means below)
   - A message from a contractor or third-party service provider
   - From an alert in one of your monitoring systems either inside or
     external to AWS (for example, in AWS, in this particular situation, it
     could be via an Amazon GuardDuty finding, either directly in GuardDuty,
     or via AWS Security Hub, or it could be via a [CloudWatch metric indicating a change in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudwatch-alarms-for-cloudtrail.html#cloudwatch-alarms-for-cloudtrail-iam-policy-changes) or from your own systems ingesting AWS data)
   - Alarms or observations that resources have been created in your
     account that cannot be accounted for in your CMDB, exist in regions that
     you do not operate infrastructure in, or themselves have generated
     alerts ([[Amazon Detective](https://aws.amazon.com/detective/getting-started/) is a useful tool for understanding these relationships)
   - Via an anonymous tip
   - Via independent or external security researchers
   - Where credentials have been compromised, you are less likely to be
     contacted via the threat actor, as in this situation typically they want
     to maximize their use of resources and minimize the chance of being
     discovered, unless the compromise is being used to exfiltrate data or
     cause some other kind of public incident such as through the
     modification of your publicly facing resources
2. Confirm a ticket/case has been raised for the incident. If not, manually raise one
3. Determine and begin to document any end-user
   impact/experience of the issue. From a user’s perspective, for this type
   of scenario, there may be no direct user impact. Findings should be
   documented in the ticket/case related to the incident
4. In the case of automatically created tickets/cases,
   determine what internal alarms/metrics are currently indicating an issue
   (what caused the ticket to be created?) This may be an Amazon
   CloudWatch metric indicating an API was called that included a reference
   to an AWS policy, or an AWS Config rule that indicates some aspect of
   your AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) configuration has fallen
   out of compliance, or an Amazon GuardDuty alert that indicates possible
   credential compromise. It may also be a billing alert where your billing
   costs have passed a predetermined threshold, triggering an alarm and
   notification. Determine exactly which of these has caused the
   ticket/case to be raised
5. Determine the set of credentials that have been
   compromised. Note that there will be additional steps in Part 3 to deal
   with scenarios where threat actors have planted resources to gain an
   account foothold.
   1. If an internal ticket/case has been created, review the case to
      determine if the user/role name or ARN, user or role ID, or Access Key
      ID are provided in that ticket. If it is not, reference the alert
      specified in the ticket (for example, a GuardDuty finding) and go to
      point 2., below
   2. If the alert has come from GuardDuty or AWS Security Hub, locate the
      specific event in the service’s AWS console and then locate the Access
      Key ID for the impacted credentials. In GuardDuty, this will be located
      under the “Resource” section of the finding. “resourceType” should be
      Access Key and there will be a field named accessKeyDetails that will
      contain the Access Key ID, Principal ID, User Type and additional
      information
6. Determine the likely time at which the credentials were
   compromised (any API actions taken post that time should be considered
   as malicious and any resources created post that time should be
   considered compromised). As an example, for a GuardDuty finding, note
   the “eventFirstSeen” field in the “Service” section of the finding.
7. If there is service disruption for your application
   occurring (see point 2, above), determine if there are any known events
   that could be causing that disruption that may not be related to the
   credential leakage (deployed CRs or other application modifications, for
   example). Check the deployment pipeline to determine if any changes
   have been made leading up to the event (the time the event was first
   recorded, or the time the automated system cut the ticket/case)
8. Incident Communications:
   1. Identify stakeholder roles from the application entry in the
      Configuration Management Database (CMDB) entry for that application, or
      via the application’s risk register
   2. Open a conference bridge war room for the incident
   3. Notify identified stakeholders including (if required) legal
      personnel, technical teams and developers and add them to the ticket and
      the war room, so they are updated as the ticket is updated
9. External Communications:
   1. Ensure your organizations legal counsel is informed and is included
      in status updates to internal stakeholders and especially in regards to
      external communications.
   2. For colleagues in the organization that are responsible for
      providing public/external communication statements, ensure these
      internal stakeholders are added to the ticket so they receive regular
      status updates regarding the incident and can complete their own
      requirements for communications within and external to the business.
   3. If there are regulations in your jurisdiction requiring reporting of
      such incidents, ensure the people in your organization responsible for
      notifying local or federal law enforcement agencies are also notified of
      the event/added to the ticket. Consult your legal advisor and/or law
      enforcement for guidance on collecting and preserving the evidence and
      chain of custody.
   4. There may not be regulations, but either open databases, government
      agencies or NGOs may track this type of activity. Your reporting may
      assist others

### Part 2: Contain the Incident

The immediate task will be to disable compromised
credentials or revoke permissions associated with those credentials,
thereby preventing any further API activity using the compromised
credentials.

1. For the compromised credential identified from Part 1, disable those credentials
   1. If they are long term IAM user credentials, [disable them using the IAM console or API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html)
   2. If they are short term credentials obtained via the AWS Security
      Token Service (AWS STS) they will be associated with an IAM role. There
      are a couple of options available to disable these:
      1. [Revoke all current role sessions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_revoke-sessions.html) (note that if the threat actor has the ability to obtain new credentials, this won’t solve the problem)
      2. If the threat actor is able to obtain another set of credentials and
         the activity continues, it will then be necessary to remove all IAM
         policies attached to the role, modify the attached policies to block all
         access, or modify the role’s trust policy to prevent the actor from
         assuming the role. As the credentials will remain valid for the
         specified time duration once issued, it is important to note that
         modifying the trust policy will allow any current valid credentials to
         continue to be used whilst still valid
         **Note that the above actions (step 2, substeps 1 and 2) will stop
         all users from using credentials obtained by assuming the role,
         including any legitimate users or applications**
2. The compromised credentials should now be disabled. Verify this by
   checking the AWS CloudTrail console for the next 30 minutes or so for
   ongoing credential use, whether by access key, IAM user, or Role.

### Part 3: Eradicate the Incident

Now it is time to further investigate what API actions the
compromised credentials have performed since the compromise occurred,
and then determine if additional resources need to be deleted,
terminated, or investigated further. From Part 1, you have identified
the compromised credentials, and the likely time of compromise. It will
now be necessary to determine what API actions have been performed and
what resources have been created, deleted or modified after that time.

1. Using your preferred monitoring tool, access CloudTrail and search
   for all API actions performed by the compromised credentials, from the
   date and time of compromise through to the current time:

   1. If this tool is a third-party tool such as Splunk, Sumo Logic or
      others, follow the normal procedure for obtaining log information from
      that tool
   2. If you do not ingest CloudTrail logs into a third-party tool, but do
      send those logs to Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), you will
      be able to use Amazon Athena to query the logs. The remaining steps will
      focus on AWS tools to retrieve the necessary information

2. [Create an Athena table referencing the bucket containing your CloudTrail logs](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/athena-tables-search-cloudtrail-logs/) that link also includes example queries that can be run in Athena
3. In the Athena console, run a query that shows all API actions taken by the compromised credentials post-compromise date/time
4. From the resulting list, determine which API calls:

   - Accessed sensitive data (such as S3 GetObject)
   - Created new AWS resources, such as databases, Amazon Elastic Compute
     Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, AWS Lambda functions or S3 buckets, etc.
   - Services that create resources should also be carefully checked
     [for ….], these include Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, Amazon EC2 Spot
     Fleets, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)/Amazon Container
     Service (Amazon ECS) clusters, etc.
   - Created or modified AWS identity resources that could be used to
     extend a foothold into the account (or other accounts, for example with
     AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) API methods such as AssumeRole).
     Within an account, API methods including (but not limited to) the
     following should also be investigated:
     - CreateUser
     - CreateRole
     - AssumeRole\*
     - Get\*Token
     - Attach\*Policy
     - RunInstances (especially with PassRole)
     - _Image_
     - \*Provider
     - Tag\*
     - Untag\*
     - Create\*
     - Delete\*
     - Update\*
     - etc.

   4. Deleted existing AWS resources
   5. Modified existing AWS resources

5. Based on the results of the previous step, determine if any applications are potentially impacted:

   1. Obtain the ARN and/or tag information for each resource impacted (from step 4, above)
   2. Go back to the CMDB and determine which application that resource belongs to
   3. Notify the application owner based on the results of the above steps

6. Based on the above results, if additional credential-obtaining
   resources have been created (IAM users, roles, EC2 instances with roles,
   etc.), take the following steps:

   1. Disable and/or delete any credentials for those resources, as per the steps outlined in Part 2, Step 1
   2. Use your preferred logging tool to analyze CloudTrail again, this
      time specifying the additionally discovered credentials as a query
      parameter, as outlined in Part 3, steps 1 through to 6 (this step).
      Continue to iterate through this process until you discover that there
      were no further resources created capable of obtaining valid credentials
      for the AWS account.
   3. For each set of newly discovered compromised credentials, go through
      the following steps from 7 in Part 3 (below) and all relevant steps in
      Part 4, also below

7. For new resources created during the compromise: Delete all
   resources created by the compromised credentials that were created post
   the date/time of the compromise occurring
8. For handling resources that were modified or deleted during the compromise, see Part 4

### Part 4: Recover from the Incident

1. For resources that were modified during the compromise:
   1. If the resource can be destroyed and replaced, do so. For example,
      EC2 instances in an EC2 Auto Scaling group, with a Launch Configuration
      referencing a non-compromised AMI, or Launch Templates used to create
      EC2 instances, terminate the instance, allow EC2 Auto Scaling to add a
      new one
   2. If the resource cannot be replaced, either:
      1. Restore the resource from a known good backup, or;
      2. Prepare a new resource and configure it into the application’s
         infrastructure, while isolating the compromised resource and removing it
         from the application’s infrastructure. Update the CMDB accordingly
      3. Either destroy the compromised resource, or continue to leave it isolated for post-incident forensics
2. For resources that were deleted during the compromise:
   1. Determine what (if any) application the resource belonged to, by
      checking in the CMDB, or confirming the resource’s tag(s) (Check AWS
      Config if the tags aren’t listed in the CloudTrail entry and the [resource is supported by AWS Config](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/resource-config-reference.html))
   2. If the deleted resource can be restored from backup, commence the restore procedure
   3. If the deleted resource cannot be restored from backup, consult the
      CMDB to obtain the resource’s configuration, and recreate the resource
      and configure it into the application’s infrastructure

### Part 5: Post-Incident Activity

This activity contains two parts. Firstly, some
compromised resources may require forensic analysis, either to fulfil
regulatory obligations or improved incident handling, both taking input
from the root cause analysis that will result from forensic
investigation. The second part is a “sharpen the saw” activity which
helps teams to assess their response to the actual incident, determine
what worked and what didn’t, update the process based on that
information and record these findings.

Firstly, perform any required forensic investigation to
determine (for compromised resources) what methods the actors may have
used and to determine if additional risks and risk mitigations are
required for the resources and/or applications in question.

1. For any compromised resources that have been isolated for further
   analysis, perform the forensic activity on those resources and
   incorporate the findings into the post-incident report.
2. Ensure that the CMDB is correctly updated to reflect the current status of all resources and applications impacted

Secondly, review the incident itself and the response to
it, to determine if anything needs to be changed for handling any
similar incidents in the future.

1. Review the incident handling and the incident handling process with key stakeholders identified in Part 1, Step 8.
2. Document lessons learned, including attack vector(s) mitigation(s), misconfiguration, etc.
3. Store the artifacts from this process with the application
   information in the CMDB entry for the application and also in the CMDB
   entry for the credential compromise response process.
